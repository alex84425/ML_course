- HW01: about LSE and newton method
    1.  LU decomposition
    2.  matrix object oriented for matrix
    3.  visualization
- HW02: bayes classifier with continous and discrete method and beta_online_learning
    1. discrete mode: 73% accuracy (bad performance, because about 80% is general result.)
    2. continous mode: 60~73% accuracy (depend on smooth parameter)
    3. online learning: a peice of cake
- HW03: Baysian Linear regression
    1. a. univariate gaussian data generator, one outcome ~ N(m, s)
       b. polynomial basis linear model (y = WTPhi(x)+e ; e ~ N(0, a)) data generator
    2. Sequential estimate the mean and variance from the data given from the univariate gaussian data generator
    3. Baysian Linear regression
